# Mastree


We are five computer science and informatics students passionate about learning and technology. Together, we came up with Mastree.  Mastree is an online education platform with the mission of helping you learn the technical and foundational skills that are needed for todayâ€™s world. With Mastree you can access a relevant variety of technical and life oriented courses to help you sharpen your skills.   Technology can make our lives much easier, but for many of us, it is frustrating and overwhelming to keep up with. Subsequently, we saw the potential in fostering growth and development in this domain.   Ultimately, through Mastree, we are providing resources that enable people to gain confidence using technology for their personal and professional needs.
